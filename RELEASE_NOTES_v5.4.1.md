**Release Date**: 2025-10-29
**Version Type**: Patch Release
**Previous Version**: v5.4.0

## üéØ Release Summary

Version 5.4.1 delivers critical bug fixes for the assessment recording integration and dashboard visualization system, ensuring complete data visibility and consistent user experience across all monitoring features.

## üêõ Key Bug Fixes

### Assessment Recording Integration

**Problem**: Command executions weren't properly recording to unified storage, limiting dashboard visibility and learning integration.

**Solution**:
- **NEW**: `lib/assessment_recorder.py` - Unified assessment recording module
- **Enhanced**: documentation-generator and git-repository-manager agents with auto-recording
- **Improved**: Cross-command tracking for consistent assessment format
- **Added**: Automatic assessment storage for all 39 commands

**Impact**: Complete visibility into command execution outcomes with automatic learning integration.

### Dashboard Display Fixes

**Problem 1**: Model legends showed inconsistent ordering across dashboard charts, creating confusion in performance visualizations.

**Solution**:
- **Added**: `_get_model_sort_key()` function for consistent model ordering
- **Fixed**: Legend consistency across all performance charts
- **Enhanced**: Claude models now appear first consistently

**Problem 2**: Recent activities weren't showing today's data, making it appear that current work wasn't being tracked.

**Solution**:
- **Fixed**: Timestamp parsing and normalization issues
- **Enhanced**: Activity detection for current day
- **Improved**: Real-time dashboard updates for today's completed tasks

**Impact**: Accurate, real-time dashboard with consistent visual presentation and complete activity tracking.

### System Improvements

**Validation Controller Fix**
- **Fixed**: `validate:all` command delegation to proper agent path
- **Corrected**: autonomous-agent prefix for validation operations
- **Ensured**: Consistent naming convention across all command references

**Enhanced Assessment Capabilities**
- **NEW**: `lib/add_today_assessments.py` for retroactive data capture
- **Improved**: Automatic AI model detection for assessments
- **Enhanced**: Windows compatibility for assessment storage
- **Added**: Thread safety for concurrent operations
