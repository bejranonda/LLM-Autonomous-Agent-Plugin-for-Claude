# Command Migration Guide: v3.7.1 ‚Üí v4.0.0

## üö® Breaking Changes

Version 4.0.0 introduces a complete reorganization of slash commands into **logical categories**. All commands now use a `category:action` format for better organization and discoverability.

**Summary of Changes:**
- **22 commands** reorganized into **7 clear categories**
- All command names now follow `category:action` pattern
- **No functional changes** - all features work exactly the same
- Old command names no longer supported (major version upgrade)

## Benefits of New Structure

### üéØ Easy Discovery
Type `/dev:` to see all development commands, `/analyze:` for analysis tools, etc.

### üìÅ Logical Grouping
Related commands are grouped by function:
- **Development**: `dev:auto`, `dev:release`, `dev:pr-review`
- **Analysis**: `analyze:project`, `analyze:quality`, `analyze:static`, `analyze:dependencies`
- **Validation**: `validate:all`, `validate:fullstack`, `validate:plugin`, `validate:patterns`

### üîç Clear Purpose
Category prefixes immediately tell you what the command does:
- `dev:auto` - Development automation
- `analyze:quality` - Analysis of quality
- `validate:fullstack` - Validation of full-stack
- `debug:gui` - Debugging GUI
- `learn:analytics` - Learning analytics
- `workspace:organize` - Workspace organization
- `monitor:dashboard` - Monitoring dashboard

### üöÄ Future Extensibility
Easy to add new commands in existing categories:
- `dev:test` - Run comprehensive tests
- `analyze:security` - Security analysis
- `validate:api` - API contract validation
- `debug:performance` - Performance debugging
- `learn:export` - Export learned patterns
- `workspace:backup` - Backup workspace
- `monitor:alerts` - Set up alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: My old commands don't work anymore**
A: This is a breaking change in v4.0.0. Use the new command names from the reference table above.

**Q: I can't remember the new command names**
A: Type the category prefix (e.g., `/dev:`) and you'll see all available commands in that category.

**Q: Where did `/git-release-workflow` go?**
A: It's been merged into `/dev:release` for consistency. All functionality is preserved.

**Q: How do I find a specific command?**
A: Think about the category:
- Development tasks ‚Üí `dev:`
- Analysis tasks ‚Üí `analyze:`
- Validation tasks ‚Üí `validate:`
- Debugging tasks ‚Üí `debug:`
- Learning/analytics ‚Üí `learn:`
- Workspace management ‚Üí `workspace:`
- Monitoring tasks ‚Üí `monitor:`
