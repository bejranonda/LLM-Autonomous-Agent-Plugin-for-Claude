### 💥 **BREAKING CHANGE: Command Naming Convention Migration**

This release implements a major breaking change to fix command discovery issues and improve the user experience.

#### ⚠️ **Migration Required**
All slash commands have been migrated from hyphen-separated names (`/command-name`) to colon-separated names (`/category:command`) to ensure proper command discovery and align with Claude Code conventions.
