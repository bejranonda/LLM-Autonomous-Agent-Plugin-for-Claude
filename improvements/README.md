# Plugin Improvements System

This directory contains structured improvement prompts generated by the `/improve-plugin` command based on user experience analysis.

## Files

### `unified-improvements.json`
Main storage for all improvement prompts. This file is automatically updated by the `/improve-plugin` command and contains structured JSON data that can be consumed by Claude Code for continuous plugin development.

### `sample-improvement.json`
Example of the improvement data structure and content that the system generates.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Plugin executes tasks and stores patterns
2. **Experience Analysis**: `/improve-plugin` analyzes usage patterns, performance metrics, and learning data
3. **Improvement Generation**: System generates evidence-based improvement suggestions
4. **Unified Storage**: All improvements stored in standardized JSON format
5. **Claude Code Integration**: Improvements can be automatically consumed for development

## JSON Schema

Each improvement analysis includes:
- **Analysis metadata**: timestamp, model used, scope
- **Key findings**: success patterns, improvement opportunities
- **Improvement prompts**: prioritized, evidence-based suggestions
- **Usage insights**: command popularity, feature utilization
- **Learning trends**: performance progression over time
- **Next steps**: actionable implementation roadmap

## Integration with Claude Code

The unified improvements JSON can be consumed by Claude Code to:
- Automatically suggest plugin improvements
- Prioritize development tasks based on user experience
- Track impact of implemented improvements
- Generate new feature ideas from usage patterns

## Usage

```bash
# Generate new improvements based on recent experience
/improve-plugin

# Focus on specific areas
/improve-plugin --focus debugging
/improve-plugin --focus quality

# Custom timeframe
/improve-plugin --days 7
```

This system represents a key innovation in autonomous plugin development, creating a continuous feedback loop where user experiences directly drive plugin evolution.
