# Simple Plugin Discovery Solution

## Problem Solved

Users running `/monitor:dashboard` from any project directory were getting "File not found" errors because the template-based approach was failing.

## Root Cause

- **Template Issue**: `{PLUGIN_PATH}` placeholder was resolving to project directory instead of user's plugin directory
- **Python Discovery**: Claude Code couldn't find Python scripts to begin with
- **Complexity**: Over-engineered solutions with multiple failure points

## Simple Solution

Instead of complex template systems, use **direct bash discovery**:

```bash
# Method 1: Find plugin in marketplace locations
PLUGIN_DIR=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/LLM-Autonomous-Agent-Plugin-for-Claude ~/.config/claude/plugins/marketplaces/LLM-Autonomous-Agent-Plugin-for-Claude 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Method 2: Execute if found
if [ -n "$PLUGIN_DIR" ] && [ -f "$PLUGIN_DIR/lib/dashboard.py" ]; then
    python "$PLUGIN_DIR/lib/dashboard.py" --patterns-dir .claude-patterns
else
    # Method 3: Fallback to development mode
    if [ -f "lib/dashboard.py" ]; then
        python lib/dashboard.py --patterns-dir .claude-patterns
    else
        echo "ERROR: Plugin installation not found"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

## Key Benefits

✅ **No Templates**: Eliminates template replacement issues
✅ **No Python Discovery**: Uses basic bash commands only
✅ **Self-Contained**: Each command handles its own discovery
✅ **Universal**: Works from any directory
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS variants provided
✅ **Fallback Support**: Development mode when marketplace not found
✅ **Simple**: Minimal code, fewer failure points

## How It Works

1. **Discovery**: Uses `find` to locate plugin in standard marketplace locations
2. **Validation**: Checks if `dashboard.py` exists in found location
3. **Execution**: Runs script from plugin directory with current working directory for data
4. **Fallback**: Falls back to development mode if marketplace not found

## Cross-Platform Support

**Linux/macOS**: Uses bash `find` command
**Windows PowerShell**: Uses `Get-ChildItem` with path discovery
**Windows cmd.exe**: Uses `dir` command with file search

## Testing Results

✅ **Marketplace Discovery**: Works from any directory
✅ **Development Mode**: Works when running from plugin source
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear messages when plugin not found
✅ **Data Access**: Preserves current working directory for project data

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Updated `/monitor:dashboard` command with robust discovery
- ✅ Added cross-platform variants for Windows, Linux, macOS
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user guidance
- ✅ Documentation updated with new approach
- ✅ Tested successfully on Windows marketplace installation

## User Impact

**Before**: Plugin commands failed with "File not found" errors
**After**: Plugin works seamlessly from any project directory

**Key Improvement**: Users can now install the plugin from marketplace and immediately use commands like `/monitor:dashboard` from any project without configuration or setup.
