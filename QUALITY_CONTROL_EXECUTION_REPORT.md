1. `lib/backfill_assessments.py:44` - f-string: expecting '}'
2. `lib/backup_manager.py:313` - closing parenthesis mismatch
3. `lib/calculate_debugging_performance.py:43` - unmatched ')'
4. `lib/command_validator.py:267` - unterminated string literal

### [HIGH] Missing Type Hints

**Count:** 5 files with missing typing imports
**Files Affected:**
- `deterministic_fixes.py`
- `lib/dashboard_launcher.py`
- `lib/enhanced_github_release.py`
- `lib/performance_integration.py`

   - Focus on unmatched parentheses and f-string issues
   - Test each file after fixing

2. **Enable Learning System** (5 minutes)
   - Set `global_learning_enabled: true` in patterns database
   - Critical for autonomous improvement

### Short-term (High Priority)

1. **Add Missing Type Hints** (1 hour)
   - Import typing modules in 5 affected files
   - Improves code maintainability and IDE support

2. **Improve Documentation Scoring** (1 hour)
   - Adjust algorithm to properly value 191 markdown files
   - Factor in agent/skill documentation quality

### Medium-term (Medium Priority)
