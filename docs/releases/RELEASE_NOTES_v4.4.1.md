## üîß Bug Fix

### Issue: Dashboard Quality Timeline Endpoint Failure

**Problem**:
- The `/api/quality-timeline` API endpoint was throwing a `KeyError: 'Unknown'`
- This caused the dashboard to fail loading quality timeline data
- Users experienced incomplete dashboard functionality

**Root Cause**:
```python
# In lib/dashboard.py line 1167:
# Incorrect variable reference caused KeyError when processing model data
days_with_model = sum(1 for day in timeline_data if model in day_data and day[model] > 0)
# Should be:
days_with_model = sum(1 for day in timeline_data if model in day and day[model] > 0)
```

**Solution**:
- Fixed the variable reference in the quality timeline calculation
- Changed `day_data` to `day` in the condition check
- Ensured proper data structure access for model performance tracking
