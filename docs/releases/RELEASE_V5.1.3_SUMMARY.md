# Release v5.1.3 Preparation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Version**: 5.1.3 (Patch Release)
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Release

## Release Analysis

### Version Bump Decision
- **Type**: Patch Release (5.1.2 → 5.1.3)
- **Reason**: Bug fixes and performance improvements for dashboard functionality
- **Impact**: No breaking changes, focused on stability and user experience

### Key Changes Included

#### 1. Dashboard Model Detection Fix ✅
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed hardcoded "Claude Sonnet 4.5" regardless of actual model used
- **Solution**: Implemented dynamic model detection using `detect_current_model()`

- **Impact**: Accurate model display (GLM-4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.5, etc.)

#### 2. Dashboard Loading Error Resolution ✅
- **Problem**: "Error loading dashboard data. Retrying..." due to Promise.all() failures
- **Solution**: Added `safeFetch()` helper with individual error handling and fallback data
- **Files**: `lib/dashboard.py` (JavaScript frontend code)
- **Impact**: Dashboard continues functioning even when individual APIs fail

#### 3. JavaScript Syntax Fixes ✅
- **Problem**: Invalid escape sequences in regex patterns causing frontend failures
- **Solution**: Fixed regex escaping in Python string context
- **Files**: `lib/dashboard.py`
- **Impact**: Resolved JavaScript execution errors

#### 4. Data Aggregation Improvements ✅
- **Problem**: Timeline chart and performance records table issues
- **Solution**: Enhanced data aggregation and caching mechanisms
- **Files**: Multiple utility files in `lib/`
- **Impact**: Better performance and data consistency
