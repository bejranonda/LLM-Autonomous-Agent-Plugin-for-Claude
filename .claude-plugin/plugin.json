  "version": "5.8.0",
  "description": "Enterprise-grade autonomous intelligence system with 98% operation success rate and 92.3/100 quality score. Revolutionary pattern-based decision making with 30+ stored patterns driving optimal routing, predictive analytics engine with 70% accuracy, and multi-agent communication protocol coordinating 22 specialized agents. Features complete background processing with non-blocking parallel execution, real-time performance analytics dashboard with 85% faster startup, and full-stack validation with 80-90% auto-fix success. Enhanced learning system with exponential improvement velocity, cross-project knowledge transfer (75% success rate), and unified parameter storage architecture eliminating data fragmentation. Comprehensive capabilities include CodeRabbit-level PR reviews, 40+ linters across 15+ languages, OWASP Top 10 security coverage, multi-ecosystem dependency scanning (11 package managers), and automatic browser opening for zero-friction dashboard access. Features 22 agents, 17 skills, and 39 commands across 8 categories with simplified naming convention: development (/dev:auto, /dev:commit, /dev:release, /dev:model-switch, /dev:pr-review), analysis (/analyze:project, /analyze:quality, /analyze:static, /analyze:dependencies, /analyze:explain, /analyze:repository), validation (/validate:all, /validate:fullstack, /validate:integrity, /validate:commands, /validate:plugin, /validate:patterns), debugging (/debug:eval, /debug:gui), learning (/learn:init, /learn:analytics, /learn:performance, /learn:predict, /learn:history, /learn:clone), workspace (/workspace:organize, /workspace:reports, /workspace:improve, /workspace:update-readme, /workspace:update-about), monitoring (/monitor:dashboard, /monitor:recommend). Complete autonomous operation with zero human intervention required, intelligent agent coordination, pattern-based decision making, and enterprise-grade quality assurance. Platform-agnostic release workflow with automatic detection (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket). Zero cost, open source, privacy-first.",
