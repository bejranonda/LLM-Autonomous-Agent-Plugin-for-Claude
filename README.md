# Autonomous Claude Agent Plugin

A comprehensive Claude Code plugin that implements **true autonomous agent behavior** with **automatic continuous learning**, pattern recognition, skill auto-selection, background task execution, and comprehensive quality control.

## 🎯 Key Innovation: Automatic Learning

**Every task makes the agent smarter**. The plugin automatically learns from successes and failures, continuously improving performance without any manual intervention.

```
Task 1 → Executes → Learns silently → Stores pattern
Task 2 (similar) → Auto-applies learned approach → Better quality → Learns more
Task 3 (similar) → Even better → Faster → Higher quality
```

**No configuration required. No manual training. Just automatic continuous improvement.**

---

## Quick Start: Watch It Learn

### Step 1: Initialize Learning (First Time Only)

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
cd ~/your-project
claude
```

**Windows**:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourName\your-project
claude
```

Then in Claude Code:
```
/learn-patterns
```

This creates `.claude/patterns/` directory with the learning database.

### Step 2: Let It Learn From Your Tasks

Just use Claude Code normally. **Learning happens automatically!**

**Example - First Refactoring Task**:
```
You: "Refactor the user authentication module to improve security"

Agent:
✓ Analyzing task (type: refactoring, context: auth, security-critical)
✓ No previous patterns found - using default skills
✓ Loading: code-analysis, quality-standards, pattern-learning
✓ Delegating to code-analyzer...
✓ Refactoring complete (Quality: 88/100)
✓ [SILENT] Learning pattern for future similar tasks...
```

**Example - Second Refactoring Task** (Later that day):
```
You: "Refactor the payment processing module"

Agent:
✓ Analyzing task (type: refactoring, context: payment, critical)
✓ Found similar pattern: auth refactoring (88% quality, 1 use)
✓ Auto-applying learned approach!
✓ Loading: code-analysis, quality-standards (from pattern)
✓ Delegating to code-analyzer (worked well last time)...
✓ Refactoring complete (Quality: 92/100) ← BETTER!
✓ [SILENT] Updating pattern (now 90% avg quality, 2 uses)...
```

**Example - Third Refactoring Task** (Next day):
```
You: "Refactor the order management system"

Agent:
✓ Analyzing task (type: refactoring, context: business-logic)
✓ Found strong pattern: refactoring (90% avg quality, 2 uses, confidence: 95%)
✓ Auto-selecting optimal skills...
✓ Loading: code-analysis, quality-standards
✓ Delegating to code-analyzer...
✓ Also launching background security scan (learned this improves quality)
✓ Refactoring complete (Quality: 94/100) ← EVEN BETTER!
✓ [SILENT] Pattern reinforced (now 91.3% avg quality, 3 uses)
```

### Step 3: See the Learning Data (Optional)

**View Learning Progress** (Linux/Mac):
```bash
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.skill_effectiveness'
```

**View Learning Progress** (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -ExpandProperty skill_effectiveness | ConvertTo-Json
```

**View Learning Progress** (Windows Command Prompt):
```cmd
type .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json
```

### What Gets Learned Automatically

Every task completion automatically captures:

✅ **Task Context**
- Task type (refactoring, bug-fix, feature, testing, etc.)
- Programming language and framework
- Module type and complexity
- Files changed and lines modified

✅ **Execution Decisions**
- Which skills were loaded
- Which agents were delegated to
- What approach was taken
- Which tools were used
- How long it took

✅ **Outcome Metrics**
- Success/failure status
- Quality score (0-100)
- Test pass rate and coverage
- Code standards compliance
- Documentation coverage
- Errors encountered

✅ **Learned Insights**
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Bottlenecks identified
- Optimization opportunities
- Lessons for next time

### Skill Effectiveness Tracking

The system automatically tracks each skill's performance:

```json
{
  "code-analysis": {
    "total_uses": 87,
    "successful_uses": 82,
    "success_rate": 0.943,
    "avg_quality_contribution": 18.5,
    "by_task_type": {
      "refactoring": {
        "uses": 45,
        "success_rate": 0.978,
        "avg_quality": 91
      },
      "bug-fix": {
        "uses": 28,
        "success_rate": 0.893
      }
    },
    "recommended_for": ["refactoring", "bug-fix", "optimization"],
    "not_recommended_for": ["documentation"]
  }
}
```

**Automatic Adaptation**:
- Skills with high success rates get recommended more
- Skills with low success rates for specific tasks get avoided
- Optimal skill combinations are identified automatically
- Performance trends are detected and acted upon

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
# Edit Claude Code settings
echo '{"autonomous_agent": {"enable_global_learning": true}}' > ~/.config/claude/settings.json
```

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
$settings = @{autonomous_agent = @{enable_global_learning = $true}} | ConvertTo-Json
$settings | Out-File -FilePath "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\claude\settings.json"
```

Now patterns learned in one project benefit all your projects!

```

---

## Viewing Learning Progress

### Check Pattern Database

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
# View all patterns
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.'

# View skill effectiveness
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.skill_effectiveness'

# View recent patterns
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.patterns | sort_by(.timestamp) | reverse | .[0:5]'

# Count total tasks
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.patterns | length'
```

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
# View all patterns (requires PowerShell 7+ or install jq)
Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

# View skill effectiveness
(Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json).skill_effectiveness | ConvertTo-Json

# Count total tasks
(Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json).patterns.Count
```

**Windows Command Prompt**:
```cmd
REM View file contents

```

### Understanding the Quality Score

The system automatically calculates quality for every task:

```
Quality Score (0-100) =
  Tests Passing      (30 points) +
  Standards Compliance (25 points) +
  Documentation      (20 points) +
  Pattern Adherence  (15 points) +
  Code Metrics       (10 points)

Threshold: 70/100
```

**Automatic Actions**:
- Score ≥ 70: ✅ Task marked successful, pattern stored
- Score < 70: ⚠️ Auto-correction triggered, iterate until ≥ 70
- Score ≥ 85: ⭐ Pattern marked as "high quality" for priority reuse
- Score < 60: 🔍 Flagged for analysis, skills reviewed

---

## Monitoring Learning Improvements

### Track Quality Improvements Over Time

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
# Extract quality scores from all patterns
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.patterns[].outcome.quality_score'

# Calculate average
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '[.patterns[].outcome.quality_score] | add / length'
```

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
# Extract quality scores
$patterns = (Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json).patterns
$patterns | ForEach-Object { $_.outcome.quality_score }

# Calculate average
($patterns | Measure-Object -Property {$_.outcome.quality_score} -Average).Average
```

### View Skill Rankings

See which skills perform best:

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.skill_effectiveness | to_entries | sort_by(.value.success_rate) | reverse | .[0:5]'
```

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
$skills = (Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json).skill_effectiveness
$skills.PSObject.Properties | Sort-Object {$_.Value.success_rate} -Descending | Select-Object -First 5
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Skill Weighting

You can adjust which skills get priority for specific task types:

**Edit** `.claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json`:
```json
{
  "skill_effectiveness": {
    "code-analysis": {
      "priority_boost": 1.2,  // 20% priority boost
      "task_type_overrides": {
        "refactoring": 1.5  // 50% boost for refactoring
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Pattern Expiration

Old patterns can be expired to favor recent learnings:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "pattern_expiration_days": 90,  // Patterns older than 90 days get lower priority
    "min_reuse_count": 3  // Only reuse patterns used successfully 3+ times
  }
}
```

### Learning Rate Adjustment

Control how quickly the system adapts:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "learning_rate": 0.8,  // 0.0 = no learning, 1.0 = maximum learning
    "confidence_threshold": 0.75  // Only auto-apply patterns with 75%+ confidence
  }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pattern Database Not Found

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
# Initialize learning
cd ~/your-project
claude
> /learn-patterns

# Verify creation
ls -la .claude/patterns/
```

**Windows**:
```powershell
# Initialize learning
cd C:\your-project
claude
> /learn-patterns

# Verify creation
dir .claude\patterns\
```

### Skill Not Auto-Loading

Check skill effectiveness metrics:

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
cat .claude/patterns/learned-patterns.json | jq '.skill_effectiveness["skill-name"]'
```

**Windows**:
```powershell
((Get-Content .claude\patterns\learned-patterns.json | ConvertFrom-Json).skill_effectiveness)."skill-name"
```

If success rate is low, the skill may be avoided. Manually boost it:
```json
{
  "skill_effectiveness": {
    "skill-name": {
      "manual_boost": 1.3
    }
  }
}
```

### Learning Seems Slow

The system needs data to learn. Accelerate learning:

```
/auto-analyze  # Builds baseline patterns
[Do 5-10 similar tasks]  # Provides learning data
[System automatically improves from task 3-4 onwards]
```

### Reset Learning (Start Fresh)

**Linux/Mac**:
```bash
rm -rf .claude/patterns/
claude
> /learn-patterns
```

**Windows PowerShell**:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .claude\patterns\
claude
> /learn-patterns
```

**Windows Command Prompt**:
```cmd
rmdir /S /Q .claude\patterns
claude
> /learn-patterns
```
