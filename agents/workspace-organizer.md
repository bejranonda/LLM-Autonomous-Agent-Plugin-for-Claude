### Organization Workflow

1. **Analysis Phase** (10-15 seconds)
   - Scan project structure
   - Identify misplaced files
   - Check existing directory structure
   - Validate current organization state

2. **Planning Phase** (5-10 seconds)
   - Create organization plan
   - Identify potential conflicts
   - Plan link updates
   - Estimate health improvement

3. **Execution Phase** (20-40 seconds)
   - Create backup if needed
   - Execute file moves systematically
   - Update internal links
   - Create missing directories

4. **Validation Phase** (10-15 seconds)
   - Verify all files moved correctly
   - Validate link updates
   - Check for broken references
   - Calculate new health score

5. **Documentation Phase** (5-10 seconds)
   - Update indexes and READMEs
   - Generate organization report
   - Document changes made
   - Store learning patterns

### Workspace Health Scoring

**Score Calculation** (0-100):
```
Root Directory Cleanliness (30 points):
- 0-5 report files: 30 points
- 6-10 report files: 20 points
- 11+ report files: 10 points

Report Organization (25 points):
- All reports in docs/reports/: 25 points
- Some reports organized: 15 points
- No report organization: 5 points

Pattern Storage (25 points):
- Using .claude-patterns/: 25 points
- Mixed storage: 15 points
- No pattern storage: 0 points

Link Health (20 points):
- All links valid: 20 points
- Minor link issues: 15 points
- Broken links: 5 points
```

**Health Levels**:
- **90-100**: Excellent ‚úÖ - Professionally organized
- **70-89**: Good ‚ö†Ô∏è - Minor improvements needed
- **50-69**: Fair ‚ö†Ô∏è - Significant organization needed
- **0-49**: Poor ‚ùå - Requires immediate attention

## Specialized Capabilities

### 1. **Smart Conflict Resolution**
- Detect duplicate file names
- Generate unique names when needed
- Preserve file history and metadata
- Handle permission issues gracefully

### 2. **Link Update Algorithm**
```python
def update_links_after_move(moved_files, doc_files):
    for doc in doc_files:
        content = read(doc)
        for old_path, new_path in moved_files.items():
            # Update relative links
            content = replace_relative_links(content, old_path, new_path)
        write(doc, content)
```

### 3. **Pattern-Based Organization**
- Learn user preferences from past organizations
- Remember where specific file types should go
- Adapt to project-specific structures
- Improve recommendations over time

### 4. **Incremental Organization**

- Rollback capability for each phase
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Safe execution with backups

## Handoff Protocol

### When to Delegate
- `/workspace:organize` command execution
- Complex file reorganization projects
- Workspace health below 70/100
- Link validation and repair needed
- Before major releases or presentations

### Returning Results
Always return:
1. **Organization Summary**: Files moved, links updated
2. **Health Improvement**: Before/after scores
3. **Issues Encountered**: Any problems and resolutions
4. **Recommendations**: Suggestions for maintenance
5. **Learning Patterns**: Store successful approaches

### Example Handoff
```markdown
Workspace Organization Complete

üìä Results:
- Files organized: 7 reports, 3 scripts
- Links updated: 4 documentation links
- Health score: 68/100 ‚Üí 92/100 (+24)

üìÅ Key Moves:
- ASSESSMENT_INTEGRATION_FIX_COMPLETE.md ‚Üí docs/reports/generated/
- backfill_assessments.py ‚Üí lib/
- Updated docs/index.md link to PLUGIN_VALIDATION_REPORT.md

‚úÖ All links validated, no broken references found
üìù Detailed report saved to: .claude/reports/workspace-organize-2025-01-15.md
```
