# Queue Execute Command

Execute all queued tasks sequentially without requiring user intervention between tasks. Tasks are executed in priority order (critical ‚Üí high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low) and can run in the background.

## Usage

```bash
/queue:execute [--stop-on-error] [--background]
```

## Parameters

### Optional Parameters
- `--stop-on-error`: Stop execution on first task failure (default: continue)
- `--background`: Run execution in background process

## Execution Behavior

### Priority-Based Execution
Tasks are executed in this order:
1. **Critical** tasks (urgent fixes, security issues)
2. **High** priority tasks (important improvements)
3. **Medium** priority tasks (standard operations)
4. **Low** priority tasks (cleanup, optimization)

### Task Dependencies
Tasks with dependencies wait until all dependencies are completed before execution.

### Error Handling
- **Default Mode**: Continue with next task even if current task fails
- **Stop-on-Error Mode**: Halt execution on first task failure

### Retry Logic
Failed tasks are automatically retried up to their configured retry limit before being marked as failed.

## Examples

### Execute with Error Continuation
```bash
/queue:execute
```
Continues execution even if some tasks fail.

### Execute with Stop on Error
```bash
/queue:execute --stop-on-error
```
Stops execution at first failure.

### Background Execution
```bash
/queue:execute --background
```
Starts execution in background process.

### Combined Options
```bash
/queue:execute --stop-on-error --background
```
Background execution with stop-on-error behavior.

## Execution Process

1. **Task Selection**: Selects highest priority pending task with satisfied dependencies
2. **Status Update**: Updates task status to "running"
3. **Command Execution**: Executes task command (if applicable)
4. **Result Processing**: Updates task status based on execution result
5. **Retry Logic**: Retries failed tasks if retry count allows
6. **Next Task**: Moves to next pending task
7. **Completion**: Stops when no more pending tasks

## Task Types Support

| Task Type | Execution Method | Example Commands |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| `slash_command` | Executes slash command via subprocess | `/analyze:quality`, `/dev:auto` |
| `autonomous` | Marks as completed (no direct execution) | Code refactoring tasks |
| `background` | Runs background analysis processes | Performance profiling |
| `manual` | Skips execution (requires manual intervention) | Documentation reviews |

## Progress Monitoring

### Real-time Status
During execution, you'll see:
```
üöÄ Starting sequential task execution...
‚ö° Executing task: Quality Analysis (ID: task_20241228_143022_123)
‚úÖ Task completed: Quality Analysis
‚ö° Executing task: Security Scan (ID: task_20241228_143025_456)
‚úÖ Task completed: Security Scan
üèÅ Sequential execution completed
```

### Background Mode
Background execution shows:
```
üöÄ Sequential execution started in background
```

Use `/queue:status` to monitor background execution.

## Integration Points

### User Preferences
- Respects your quality threshold settings
- Uses your preferred timeout values
- Applies your retry preferences
- Learns from execution patterns

### Learning System
- Records task execution outcomes
- Updates success patterns
- Improves future suggestions
- Tracks performance metrics

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry on transient failures
- Dependency resolution for complex workflows
- Rollback capabilities for critical operations
- Error pattern recognition and prevention

## Output Format

### Foreground Execution
```
üöÄ Starting sequential task execution...
‚ö° Executing task: Quality Analysis (ID: task_20241228_143022_123)
‚úÖ Task completed: Quality Analysis
‚ö° Executing task: Security Scan (ID: task_20241228_143025_456)
‚úÖ Task completed: Security Scan
üèÅ Sequential execution completed
‚úÖ Executed 2 tasks successfully
```

### Background Execution
```
üöÄ Sequential execution started in background
üìä Use /queue:status to monitor progress
```

### Error Output
```
‚ö° Executing task: Fix Tests (ID: task_20241228_143028_789)
‚ùå Task failed: Fix Tests (Tests not found)
üõë Stopping execution due to error
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- **No Tasks**: Message when queue is empty
- **Execution Conflicts**: Handles multiple execution attempts
- **Timeout Issues**: Respects configured timeouts
- **Permission Errors**: Handles filesystem permission issues

### Recovery Strategies
- **Automatic Retry**: For transient failures
- **Dependency Resolution**: Waits for dependent tasks
- **Resource Management**: Handles system resource constraints
- **Error Logging**: Records failure details for analysis

## Performance Considerations

### System Resources
- Monitors memory usage during execution
- Manages CPU utilization for long-running tasks
- Handles disk space for logging and temp files
- Optimizes I/O operations for file-based tasks

### Execution Efficiency
- Parallel execution for independent tasks (future enhancement)
- Smart scheduling based on task complexity
- Resource pooling for repeated operations
- Caching of expensive computations

## Best Practices

1. **Test Queue**: Verify queue contents before execution
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check status during long executions
3. **Handle Errors**: Review failed tasks and retry if needed
4. **Background Mode**: Use for long-running workflows
5. **Stop on Error**: Use for critical workflows where failures matter

## Troubleshooting

### Execution Stalls
- Check `/queue:status` for current task
- Verify system resources availability
- Review task dependencies
- Check for stuck background processes

### High Failure Rate
- Review task commands and parameters
- Increase timeout values for long tasks
- Check system dependencies
- Verify file permissions

### Performance Issues
- Use background mode for long workflows
- Monitor system resource usage
- Optimize task order and priorities
- Consider task breakdown for complex operations
