## Health Score Calculation

The queue health score (0-100) is calculated based on:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Completion Rate | 40% | Ratio of completed to total tasks |
| Failure Rate | 30% | Ratio of failed to total tasks (negative impact) |
| Queue Age | 15% | Age of oldest queued task |
| Execution Consistency | 15% | Regularity of task execution |

### Health Status Levels
- **Excellent** (90-100): Optimal queue performance
- **Good** (75-89): Healthy queue with minor issues
- **Fair** (60-74): Acceptable performance with some concerns
- **Poor** (0-59): Significant issues requiring attention

## Real-time Monitoring

### Active Execution Monitoring
When tasks are running, status includes:
```
⚡ Live Execution Monitor
+- Current Task: Quality Analysis
+- Progress: 65% complete
+- Elapsed Time: 2m 15s
+- Estimated Remaining: 1m 10s
+- CPU Usage: 15%
+- Memory Usage: 250MB
+- Log Output: Analyzing src/main.py...
```

### Background Execution
For background processes:
```
🔄 Background Execution Active
+- Process ID: 12345
+- Started: 2024-12-28 14:30:00
+- Tasks Completed: 3/8
+- Current Phase: Security scanning
+- Estimated Completion: 14:45:00
```

## Performance Metrics

### Execution Statistics
- **Average Execution Time**: Mean time per completed task
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful task executions
- **Queue Throughput**: Tasks completed per hour
- **Wait Time**: Average time tasks spend in queue

### Historical Trends
- **Completion Trend**: Increasing/decreasing completion rate
- **Error Rate Trend**: Changes in failure frequency
- **Queue Load Trend**: Queue size over time
- **Performance Trend**: Execution speed changes

## Integration with Other Systems

### User Preferences
Status reflects your preference settings:
- Quality thresholds
- Priority preferences
- Timeout configurations
- Retry limits

### Learning System
Incorporates learned patterns:
- Success probability for similar tasks
- Estimated completion times
- Recommended next actions
- Risk assessments

### Performance Analytics
Displays performance insights:
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource utilization
- Optimization opportunities
- Trend analysis

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Queue Health Issues
- **High Failure Rate**: Check task commands and dependencies
- **Long Wait Times**: Review task priorities and execution speed
- **Resource Constraints**: Monitor system resources
- **Stuck Tasks**: Check for dependency loops or deadlocks

### Performance Optimization
- **Task Batching**: Group similar tasks together
- **Priority Adjustment**: Reorder tasks for better flow
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize system resource usage
- **Parallel Execution**: Enable parallel processing where possible

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check status during long executions
2. **Health Awareness**: Address queue health issues promptly
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor trends over time
4. **Resource Management**: Watch system resource usage
5. **Error Response**: Quickly address failed tasks
