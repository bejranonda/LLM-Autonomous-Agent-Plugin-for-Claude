Analyze the current project autonomously using the orchestrator agent. This will:
- Auto-detect project type and technologies
- Load relevant skills based on project context
- Run code analysis in background
- Generate comprehensive quality report
- Store learned patterns for future use

The orchestrator will make all decisions autonomously without requiring confirmation at each step.
